## **Google Colab**
- **Use Case:** Quick prototyping, experimentation, and collaboration.
- **Key Features:**
  - Free access to GPUs/TPUs.
  - Pre-installed ML/DL libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
  - Integration with Google Drive for file storage.
  - Interactive visualizations and debugging in notebooks.
  - Collaboration via shared notebooks.
- **Limitations:** Limited customizations and scalability for production-grade pipelines.

---

## **GitHub Codespaces**
- **Use Case:** Scalable, cloud-based development environments.
- **Key Features:**
  - Pre-configured environments via `.devcontainer.json`.
  - Seamless GitHub integration for version control and CI/CD.
  - Scalable for multi-user collaboration.
  - Browser-based access for coding and debugging.
  - Suitable for running and testing end-to-end MLOps pipelines.
- **Limitations:** Requires subscription for extended use; limited compute resources.

---

## **Anaconda**
- **Use Case:** Local environment management and isolated ML development.
- **Key Features:**
  - Environment isolation using `conda`.
  - Pre-packaged libraries for data science and machine learning.
  - Jupyter Notebook integration for experiment tracking.
  - Reproducible workflows and environment setup.
  - Prepares models for production deployment.
- **Limitations:** Limited scalability due to local resource constraints.

## **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
- **Use Case:** Comprehensive development with strong debugging and deployment support.
- **Key Features:**
  - Extensive extensions for Python, Docker, and Kubernetes.
  - Integrated terminal for running commands and testing pipelines.
  - Git integration for version control and automation.
  - Remote development via SSH and WSL.
  - Debugging capabilities for complex ML applications.
- **Limitations:** Requires manual configuration for advanced MLOps workflows.
