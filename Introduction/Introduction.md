   - Use ETL pipelines (Extract, Transform, Load) to process and load data into sources like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
   - Employ **Apache Airflow** for pipeline creation and scheduling.
4. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Read data from sources like AWS S3, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL.
   - Use **DVC** for data versioning to maintain change history.
5. **Feature Engineering and Selection**:
   - Perform EDA, handle missing values, outliers, and select relevant features for modeling.
6. **Model Creation and Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Test multiple models and optimize them using tools like Hyperopt, GridSearchCV, and RandomizedSearchCV.
   - Track experiments with **MLflow**.
7. **Model Deployment**:
   - Containerize applications using **Docker**.
   - Deploy models using cloud platforms like AWS SageMaker and Azure.
8. **Model Monitoring**:
   - Visualize outputs and establish monitoring rules.
   - Use **Grafana** for performance visualization.
   - Automate deployment using **GitHub Actions**.
