## Function with Decorators

## Define a function that calculates the time taken to execute another function. Apply this decorator to a function that performs a complex calculation. Test the decorated function with different inputs. This code snippet demonstrates a **decorator** in Python, which is a way to modify or enhance the behavior of a function.

### Let's break it down step by step:

---

### **1. The `timer_decorator` function:**

This is a **decorator function**, which takes another function as input and returns a new function (a "wrapped" version of the original function).

- **Parameters:**
  - `func`: The function that the decorator is applied to.
  
- **Inner function (`wrapper`):**
  - This is where the additional functionality (timing the execution) is added.
  - It records the start time using `time.time()`.
  - Executes the original function `func` with its arguments (`*args` and `**kwargs`).
  - Records the end time.
  - Prints how long the function took to execute.
  - Returns the result of the original function.

---

### **2. Applying the decorator with `@timer_decorator`:**

The line:

```python
@timer_decorator
def complex_calculation(n):
    return sum(x**2 for x in range(n))
```

is equivalent to:

```python
def complex_calculation(n):
    return sum(x**2 for x in range(n))

complex_calculation = timer_decorator(complex_calculation)
```

The `complex_calculation` function is wrapped by the `timer_decorator`. When you call `complex_calculation`, you're actually calling the `wrapper` function inside `timer_decorator`.

---

### **3. The `complex_calculation` function:**

This function computes the sum of the squares of integers from `0` to `n-1`. 

For example:
- `complex_calculation(5)` computes \( 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 30 \).

---

### **4. Running the test:**

When you call:

```python
print(complex_calculation(10000))
```

Hereâ€™s what happens:
1. The `wrapper` function starts timing.
2. The original `complex_calculation` function is executed with `n=10000`.
   - It computes the sum of squares for numbers up to `9999`.
3. The `wrapper` function ends timing.
4. It prints the time taken by the `complex_calculation` function.
5. The result of the calculation is returned and printed.

---

### **Output Example:**

For `complex_calculation(10000)`, the output might look like this:

```
Function complex_calculation took 0.002854 seconds to execute.
333283335000
```

### **Key Concepts:**
- **Decorator:** A function that adds functionality to another function.
- **Wrapper Function:** The inner function that defines the new behavior while also calling the original function.
- **Timing Code:** `time.time()` is used to measure execution time.

This approach is useful for measuring performance or adding other functionality like logging, authentication, etc.
